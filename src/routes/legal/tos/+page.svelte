</p>

<ol type="1">
    <li>

    <li>
        <strong>Intellectual Property:</strong> The general design, text, and logos of The Nerds Catalog website are the property of The Nerds Catalog or its content suppliers and are protected by intellectual property laws. However, many products sold on this website are fan merchandise.

    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Purchasing Eligibility:</strong> By placing an order and purchasing on The Nerds Catalog, you expressly represent and warrant that you are at least 18 years of age. If you are under 18 years of age, you are not permitted to make purchases on this website. Any orders placed by individuals under 18 will be considered invalid and may be cancelled. To purchase items for an individual under 18, a legal guardian must complete the entire checkout and purchasing process.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Age Verification:</strong> While we strive to comply with all applicable regulations, The Nerds Catalog operates without an account system and relies on client-side cart handling. As such, we have limited technical means to actively verify the age of our users beyond your representation regarding your age and compliance. We urge parents and guardians to monitor their children's online activities, particularly regarding purchases. By using this website, you agree to comply with our stated age restrictions.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Pre-Orders and Event Pickup:</strong> For pre-orders designated for event pickup, it is the customer's responsibility to collect their items during the specified event period. Pre-orders not picked up during the event must be settled in person by contacting The Nerds Catalog team to arrange an alternative pickup or delivery. Additional shipping or handling fees may apply for alternative pickup/delivery arrangements.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Payment Processing:</strong> The Nerds Catalog utilizes Doku as its third-party payment gateway to securely process all online transactions. When you make a purchase, your payment information will be sent to, collected, and processed by Doku in accordance with their terms of service and privacy policy. By completing a purchase, you agree to Doku's terms and conditions and privacy policy, which govern the processing of your payment. The Nerds Catalog does not store your full payment card details or sensitive financial information on its servers.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Quality Control:</strong> The Nerds Catalog is committed to providing products that meet our standards. "Our standards" refer to the reasonable quality expectations for collectible and fan merchandise as generally understood in the industry. This means products are expected to be free from readily apparent manufacturing defects or damage, consistent with the product images and descriptions provided on The Nerds Catalog website, and in the condition (e.g., new, pre-owned) as specifically stated.
        <ul>
            <li>For shipped orders, each item undergoes a thorough visual quality control check before dispatch to ensure it meets these standards.</li>
            <li>For event pickups or direct handovers, a final visual quality control check will be performed jointly with the purchaser as a witness at the time of handover. Any readily apparent manufacturing defects or non-conformity identified and confirmed by our team during this on-the-spot inspection will result in an immediate replacement unit being provided at no additional charge, subject to availability. If a replacement is unavailable, a full refund will be issued.</li>
            Upon successful handover (whether shipped or in-person with a witnessed check), responsibility for the product's condition, including any readily apparent defects or damage, generally transfers to the purchaser. We encourage customers to inspect their items thoroughly upon receipt or at the point of handover.

                <ul>
                    <li>For event pickups or direct handovers: Any readily apparent manufacturing defects or non-conformity (wrong item, significant deviation from description/image) must be identified and resolved on the spot during the final visual quality check with our team, as outlined in the Quality Control clause. If a defect or non-conformity is confirmed by our team during this on-the-spot inspection, a replacement unit will be provided immediately at no additional charge, subject to availability.

We will assess your claim based on evidence provided (A timestamped watermarked video longer than one minute demonstrating the defect is required as evidence) and, if valid, provide a replacement or a full refund as per your rights under Indonesian Consumer Protection Law (UUPK).</li>
                    <li>The Nerds Catalog is not responsible for damages, loss, or delays that occur during the shipping process, as outlined in our Shipping & Packaging clause. Claims for such issues must be directed to the designated shipping carrier.</li>
                    <li>Claims for damage or defects arising after handover/delivery, or those not reported within the specified timeframe, may not be eligible for a refund or replacement.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>If a purchased product turns out to be **out of stock** at the time of order fulfillment, you will be eligible for a full refund.</li>
            <li>For specific pre-order items where this condition is clearly stated in the pre-order notice, a **partial refund** may become available after a predetermined date, typically linked to the conclusion of the relevant event. For pre-orders subject to this condition, the partial refund option will be available starting **December 31st, 2025, at 12:00 PM GMT+7**, or as otherwise specified in the pre-order notice. Please ensure you review your order carefully before completing your purchase.</li>
            <li>In any event that causes us to be unable to fulfill orders, you will be eligible for a full refund.</li>
